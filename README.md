# Fake Image Detection using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting and classifying fake images generated using deep learning models.
It includes two tasks:
1. Detecting real vs fake images
2. Classifying fake images generated by GAN and VAE models

## Dataset Structure
The dataset is organized as follows:

data/real/  
data/fake/  
data/external_images/  

data/classification/train/gan  
data/classification/train/vae  

data/classification/validate/gan  
data/classification/validate/vae  

data/classification/test/gan  
data/classification/test/vae  

> Note: The dataset is not included in this repository due to size limitations.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pillow

## Model
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to learn image patterns and classify images.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Open the notebook:
   fake_image_detection.ipynb
3. Run all cells to train and evaluate the model

## Results
The model performance is evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics during training and validation.
